# ML-Classification-Final-Project
Tasked with classifying  imbalanced  40,000 samples into 6 classes. The challenge was to achieve the highest possible F1 score using only Decision Trees, KNN, and Logistic Regression. Implemented custom ensemble methods, including Random Forest and One-vs-All classifiers, to enhance performance. The final model achieved an  F1 score of 95
